#STM32CubeMX to Makefile

This program generates a Makefile from an STM32CubeMX (http://www.st.com/stm32cube)-created project. It is intended to be used along with the GNU Make utility (www.gnu.org/software/make) and GNU tools for ARM (https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) to compile STM32 firmware. Refer to my blog post http://www.ba0sh1.com/opensource-stm32-development for set up of the integrated development environment.
